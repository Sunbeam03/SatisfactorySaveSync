	- Note: You may also need to enable the Open SSH Agent service on Windows: https://superuser.com/questions/1327633/how-to-maintain-ssh-agent-login-session-with-windows-10s-new-openssh-and-powers
2. Modify push.cmd
	- Add "COPY /Y .\*.sav Saved\SaveGames\YOUR_ID" for each player which will be using the cloud save
3. Run "run.bat"
	- This will pull the state of the repository, launch Satisfactory through steam, and create a watcher on the SaveGames/ folder.  Anytime a save occurs while playing the saved file will be copied to all save directories then pushed to the repository.
