5. Add your save folder to the repo. FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/YOUR_ID
6. Modify push.cmd
	- Within the file are indicators of additions you need to make due to the personalized IDs used in Satisfactory's save folder
		- Add a variable for each player's save game location, add a copy for each regular save, add an IF...COPY if you're using the Experimental branch
			- set player1Saves=Saved\SaveGames\YOUR_ID
			- COPY /Y .*.sav Saved\SaveGames\YOUR_ID
			- if not x%filename:_BAK=%==x%filename% COPY /Y %allsaves% %player1Saves%
5. Run "Satisfactory.bat"
	- This will do the following:
		Pull the state of the repository
		Find your Satisfactory folder and FactoryGame.exe and store the path for future runs
		Launch Satisfactory through Steam
		Create a watcher on the SaveGames/ folder
			Anytime a save occurs while playing the saved file will be copied to all save directories then pushed to the repository.
			NOTE: The watcher does not close when you close the game and you will need to manually close the CMD window.
