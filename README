5. Add your save folder to the repo. FactoryGame/Saved/SaveGames/YOUR_ID
6. Modify push.cmd
	- Add "COPY /Y .\*.sav Saved\SaveGames\YOUR_ID" for each player which will be using the cloud save.
5. Run "Satisfactory.bat"
	- This will do the following:
		Pull the state of the repository
		Find your Satisfactory folder and FactoryGame.exe and store the path for future runs
		Launch Satisfactory through Steam
		Create a watcher on the SaveGames/ folder
			Anytime a save occurs while playing the saved file will be copied to all save directories then pushed to the repository.
			NOTE: The watcher does not close when you close the game and you will need to manually close the CMD window.
